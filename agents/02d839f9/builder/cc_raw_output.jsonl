Add English Translations\n- Open `apps/locales/en.json`\n- Add new `scorecard` section with translations for:\n  - Section titles (CG Competency, Personal Assessment History, etc.)\n  - Competency names (Driving for Profitable Growth, etc.)\n  - Field labels (Rating, Description, Assessment Program, Key Successes, etc.)\n  - 9-Box Grid labels (Performance axis, Potential axis, grid quadrant names)\n  - Assessment terms (Outstanding, Exceeds Expectations, Meets Expectations, etc.)\n  - Common UI strings (No data messages, date labels, etc.)\n\n### 3. Add Thai Translations\n- Open `apps/locales/th.json`\n- Add corresponding Thai translations for all scorecard strings\n- Ensure competency names are accurately translated to Thai\n- Translate 9-Box Grid quadrant labels appropriately for Thai HR context\n- Maintain consistency with existing translation patterns in the file\n\n### 4. Create Scorecard Page Module\n- Create `apps/js/pages/scorecard.js`\n- Implement module pattern following `ProfileDetailsPage.render()` structure\n- Create main `render(employee)` function that checks for scorecard data\n- Implement `init()` function for any initialization logic\n- Create rendering functions for each of the 10 sections:\n  - `renderCompetenciesSection()` - Display 6 competencies with rating badges and descriptions\n  - `renderAssessmentHistorySection()` - Show timeline of assessment programs\n  - `renderAssessmentSummarySection()` - Display summary cards with overall ratings\n  - `renderKeySuccessesSection()` - List achievement items with dates and descriptions\n  - `renderStrengthsSection()` - Show top strengths as cards with icons\n  - `renderDevelopmentAreasSection()` - Display development areas with priority indicators\n  - `renderCareerAspirationsSection()` - Show short-term and long-term career goals\n  - `renderDevelopmentObjectivesSection()` - List objectives with progress indicators\n  - `renderTalentReferenceSection()` - Display talent pool and potential ratings\n  - `renderPerformancePotentialMatrixSection()` - Create visual 9-Box Grid with employee position highlighted\n  - `renderFinalCalibrationSection()` - Show overall calibration results\n- Use CardComponent.render() for section containers following existing patterns\n- Implement rating badges with color coding (green for high, yellow for medium, red for low)\n- Create 9-Box Grid visualization using HTML/CSS grid layout with proper styling\n- Handle empty states gracefully using CardComponent.emptyState()\n- Export module for usage\n\n### 5. Add Scorecard Tab to Profile Page\n- Open `apps/js/pages/profile.js`\n- Add scorecard tab object to the `tabs` array:\n  ```javascript\n  { id: 'scorecard', label: 'Scorecard', labelTh: 'สกอร์การ์ด', icon: 'assessment' }\n  ```\n- Add case for 'scorecard' in `renderTabContent()` switch statement:\n  ```javascript\n  case 'scorecard':\n      return ScorecardPage.render(employee);\n  ```\n- Add case for 'scorecard' in `initTabPage()` switch statement:\n  ```javascript\n  case 'scorecard':\n      ScorecardPage.init();\n      break;\n  ```\n\n### 6. Include Scorecard Script in HTML\n- Open `apps/index.html`\n- Add script tag in the pages section after profile-details.js:\n  ```html\n  <script src=\"js/pages/scorecard.js\"></script>\n  ```\n- Ensure proper loading order (after dependencies but before app.js)\n\n### 7. Validation and Testing\n- Open the application in browser at `http://localhost:8080`\n- Navigate to Profile page\n- Verify scorecard tab appears in the tab list with correct icon\n- Click on scorecard tab and verify content loads\n- Test each section renders correctly:\n  - Competencies show all 6 items with ratings\n  - Assessment history displays chronologically\n  - Assessment summary shows overall rating\n  - Key successes list properly formatted\n  - Strengths and development areas display as cards\n  - Career aspirations show both short and long term goals\n  - Development objectives list with proper formatting\n  - Talent reference displays correctly\n  - 9-Box Grid renders visually with employee position marked\n  - Final calibration section shows complete information\n- Switch language to Thai and verify all translations display correctly\n- Test responsive layout on different screen sizes\n- Verify empty states show appropriate messages when no data exists\n- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors\n\n## Validation Commands\n\nExecute these commands to validate the chore is complete:\n\n```bash\n# Start local development server (if not already running)\npython -m http.server 8080 -d apps\n\n# Open browser to test\nopen http://localhost:8080/#/profile?tab=scorecard\n\n# Validate JavaScript syntax (if node is installed)\nnode -c apps/js/pages/scorecard.js\n\n# Check JSON syntax for locale files\npython -m json.tool apps/locales/en.json > /dev/null && echo \"en.json is valid JSON\"\npython -m json.tool apps/locales/th.json > /dev/null && echo \"th.json is valid JSON\"\n\n# Verify all required files exist\nls -la apps/js/pages/scorecard.js\ngrep -q \"scorecard\" apps/js/pages/profile.js && echo \"Profile page updated\"\ngrep -q \"scorecard\" apps/locales/en.json && echo \"English translations added\"\ngrep -q \"scorecard\" apps/locales/th.json && echo \"Thai translations added\"\ngrep -q \"scorecard.js\" apps/index.html && echo \"Script tag added to HTML\"\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n### Design Considerations\n- Follow the exact same pattern as `ProfileDetailsPage.js` for consistency\n- Use existing components: `CardComponent`, `TabsComponent` for UI consistency\n- Implement proper i18n support using `i18n.t()` for all text strings\n- Use Material Icons for section icons matching the Central Group design system\n- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance (proper heading hierarchy, aria labels, keyboard navigation)\n\n### 9-Box Grid Implementation\n- Create a 3x3 CSS grid layout for the Performance-Potential Matrix\n- Label axes: Y-axis = Potential (High/Medium/Low), X-axis = Performance (Low/Medium/High)\n- Color code boxes appropriately:\n  - High Performance + High Potential (top right) = Green (Stars)\n  - Medium Performance + Medium Potential (center) = Yellow (Core)\n  - Low Performance + Low Potential (bottom left) = Red (Questionable)\n- Highlight the employee's current box position with a distinct visual indicator (border, shadow, or badge)\n- Make grid responsive and ensure proper rendering on mobile devices\n\n### Data Privacy\n- No sensitive financial or personal data in scorecard mock data\n- Performance ratings and assessments are mock data for demonstration purposes\n- Follow RBAC patterns - employees see their own scorecard, managers may have additional access\n\n### Future Enhancements (Not in Scope)\n- Interactive drill-down into individual competency details\n- Historical trend charts for performance over time\n- Comparison with team or company averages\n- Export scorecard as PDF\n- Add comments or feedback capability\n","numLines":187,"startLine":1,"totalLines":187}}}
